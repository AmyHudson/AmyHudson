### 
I'm interested in how climate and ecology interact across space and time. In my current ORISE postdoc with the [Scientific Computing Initiative Network (SCINet)](https://scinet.usda.gov/) at USDA's Agricultural Research Service, I focus on how these interactions impact [dryland and agroecosystems across the globe and the spread of a livestock disease across the western US](https://scinet.usda.gov/stories/2021/04/15/Hudson.html).

### 
I'm interested in how climate and ecology interact across space and time. In my current postdoc with the USDA-ARS and the [Scientific Computing Initiative Network (SCINet)](https://scinet.usda.gov/) I focus on how these interactions impact [dryland ecosystems across the globe and the spread of a livestock disease across the western US](https://scinet.usda.gov/stories/2021/04/15/Hudson.html).
